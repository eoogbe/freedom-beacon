Freedom Beacon
==============
**Let freedom ping!**

When you have a few minutes of unexpected free time, use Freedom Beacon to find
other free friends. Freedom Beacon tells you which of your friends are free,
for how long, and how close they are to help you coordinate spontaneous
hangouts.

###Glanceable interface
Use the favorites feature so your closest friends rise to the top of
your list.

###No arduous friending necessary
Freedom Beacon automatically loads all your Facebook friends, so you don't
waste time friending them again.

###Your privacy is our priority
Freedom Beacon lets you control how much you want to share. We never give out
your exact location data and you can choose not to share any distance
information at all.
